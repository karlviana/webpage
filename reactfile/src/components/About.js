                          Hi, I am an aspiring front end developer that willing to expand my knowledge, 
                          enhance my current skills, acquire experience and add new skill set.  
                          I got my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at University of Caloocan City.
                        </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className='text-lg sm:text-xl font-light text-[#1b1811]'>
                          In the long run I want to became a full stack developer to achieve 
                          that I need to learn back end programming language by taking a certification and training.
                          The learning I got in those will be my foundation to fully develop a web application not only the interface
                          but with back end function. 
                          I also want to explore more on technology field like cyber security 
                          and game development, after I achieve my goal.
